# Azure Function App: MySQL Connection for Microsoft Form Responses

## Overview

This repository contains the **MySQL Connection Function App**, a highly scalable and automated solution built using **Azure Functions** to seamlessly integrate **Microsoft Forms** with a **MySQL database**. This app demonstrates expertise in **cloud computing**, **data integration**, and **automation workflows** by leveraging **Microsoft Power Platform** capabilities for real-time data processing.

### Key Features

1. **HTTP Trigger Function**: Implements an HTTP trigger using **Azure Function App** to process incoming form responses.
2. **Data Integration**: Automatically imports data submitted through **Microsoft Forms** into a **MySQL database**.
3. **Automation with Microsoft Power Platform**: Utilizes **Microsoft Power Automate** to trigger the function app upon new form submissions.
4. **Scalability**: Designed as a serverless application, the solution scales dynamically with Azure to handle varying workloads.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Core code for the Azure Function App, including the HTTP trigger implementation.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for connecting to MySQL and setting up Azure Function environment variables.
- **`tests/`**: Test cases to validate the function’s behavior with sample payloads.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation for deploying and configuring the function app in Azure.

## Key Technologies and Tools

- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute service for building HTTP-triggered workflows.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing and managing structured form response data.
- **Microsoft Forms**: Data source for collecting real-time responses.
- **Microsoft Power Platform**: For automating workflows and triggering the function app.
- **Python**: Programming language used for the function app’s backend logic.
- **Azure Storage**: For managing function app state and configuration.

## Applications

- **Survey Automation**: Streamlines survey response collection and database storage.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Handles data ingestion in real-time as responses are submitted.
- **Workflow Automation**: Integrates seamlessly with **Microsoft Power Automate** to enable low-code automation solutions.
- **Enterprise-Scale Data Management**: Ensures efficient and reliable data storage in **MySQL** for further analytics and reporting.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Cloud Computing**: Expertise in **Azure Function App** and serverless architecture.
- **Database Integration**: Connecting cloud functions with relational databases like **MySQL**.
- **Automation Engineering**: Leveraging **Microsoft Power Platform** for workflow automation.
- **Backend Development**: Writing efficient, scalable, and reliable Python-based API logic.
- **Data Engineering**: Ensuring data quality and integrity during ingestion and storage.
- **Real-Time Systems**: Designing systems that respond dynamically to user input and data streams.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Azure Subscription** with Function App service enabled.
- **MySQL Server** and credentials for database access.
- **Microsoft Power Automate** for automation workflows.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mysql-connection-function-app.git
   cd mysql-connection-function-app

2. Configure the connection strings and environment variables in local.settings.json.
3. Deploy the function app to Azure:
   ```bash
   func azure functionapp publish <your-function-app-name>
4. Set up a Power Automate flow to trigger the function app on new Microsoft Form submissions.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional data sources like Microsoft Teams Forms or Google Forms.
- Integration with PostgreSQL or other database systems.
- Enhanced error handling and logging using Azure Monitor.
- Real-time notifications via Microsoft Teams or Slack.
